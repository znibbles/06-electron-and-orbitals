So here's a disclaimer: This video is actually the cut-up of a live coding session I did the other day. I just removed the wrong paths I've taken and cut out some lengthy pauses in order to not confuse or bore you. But otherwise this clip has been recorded without prior preparation, I just wanted to see where I can get in half an hour without knowing to much of the library But don't worry, it won't be that lengthy, so let's see how it goes.



So I came along this library called **tonejs**, and I have already been looking for a decent Web Audio API wrapper for a longer time, I decided to give it a try. One of my other side projects includes a gamelike generative audio interaction pattern, so this sounded very promising.
